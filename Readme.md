# Detroid: Became Fast

A small attempt to reduce the bottleneck on my poor cpu with this poorly optimized game.

Tested on v1.0 of the game

Don't expect miracles! This shit only prevent the game to create threads as TimeCritical that can cause the render thread to hang some times.


I tested, The 'freeze' became a 'little lag' with the use of this, but nothing to solve the problem :(
